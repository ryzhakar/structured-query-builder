# Defensive Overcorrection Documentation Archive

These documents were created after the commit 08 confession, exhibiting a pattern of 
defensive overcorrection with excessive emphasis on "honesty", "no cheating", and 
"proof of work".

While potentially accurate, they represent an overcorrection response and contain
redundant assertions. Archived for historical context.

**Pattern**: ALL CAPS "NO CHEATING", repeated "HONEST" disclaimers, excessive 
proof-of-work emphasis.

**Preserved for**: Historical record of development process post-confession.

**Current docs**: See /docs/current for consolidated, professionally-toned documentation.
