# Planning Documents Archive

These documents represent planning for future work (Phase 1 implementation).

Preserved as they may be useful for future development, but moved out of root
to reduce documentation clutter.

**Content**: Gap analyses, implementation plans, agent handoff documentation.

**Status**: Planning stage, not current implementation state.
