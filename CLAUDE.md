# Behavioral Requirements

**Proof-of-work**: Never claim implementation without runnable code + passing tests + committed files.

**Proof-of-result**: Never mark tasks complete without all acceptance criteria met and measurable outcomes delivered.

**No application layer**: Queries must be self-contained for LLM structured outputs - no handwaving to external processing.
