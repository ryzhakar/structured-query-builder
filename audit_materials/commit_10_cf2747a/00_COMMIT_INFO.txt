Subject: Update hypothesis tests for new JoinSpec structure

Message:
PROBLEM:
- Hypothesis tests were generating JoinSpec with old structure
- Used left_column/right_column instead of on_conditions
- Caused ValidationError when generating random queries

FIX:
- Updated from_clause_strategy() in test_hypothesis_generation.py
- Changed to use on_conditions with ConditionGroup
- Uses ColumnComparison for JOIN conditions
- Maintains same random generation behavior

PROOF-OF-WORK:
✅ All 7 hypothesis tests passing
✅ 320+ random queries validated
✅ Full validation suite passing

VALIDATION RESULTS:
- Unit tests: 64 tests (31 models + 22 translator + 11 column comparison) ✅
- Hypothesis: 320+ random queries ✅
- Examples: 6 pricing queries ✅
- Schema: Compatible with Vertex AI ✅
