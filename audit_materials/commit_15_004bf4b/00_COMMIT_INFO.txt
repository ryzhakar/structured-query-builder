Subject: Add intelligence model specifications and comprehensive agent handoff

Message:
PROOF-OF-WORK: Complete handoff preparation for peer agent execution of Phase 1.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Intelligence Model YAMLs (version controlled)
   - pricing_analyst_intelligence_model.yaml (200+ lines)
   - commercial_architect_intelligence_model.yaml (180+ lines)
   - Complete specifications for 19 intelligence concerns
   - Matched + Unmatched variants documented
   - Business reasoning and expected outcomes defined

2. Comprehensive Agent Handoff Document (650+ lines)
   - Current state summary (37% coverage quantified)
   - Work completed this session (4 analysis docs)
   - Detailed task breakdown (5 tasks, 10 queries)
   - Success criteria (proof-of-work + proof-of-result)
   - Execution instructions (step-by-step)
   - Testing strategy and validation
   - Common pitfalls and troubleshooting
   - Reference materials and standards reminder

HANDOFF QUALITY:
- Clear execution path: PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md → 5 tasks
- Quantified goals: 37% → 70% coverage
- All context provided: 5 priority documents listed
- Standards documented: proof-of-work discipline explained
- Success criteria defined: 10+ checkboxes for validation

ENABLING PEER AGENT:
Next agent can immediately begin Task 1 (schema fixes) with:
- Full context of what's been analyzed
- Clear understanding of gaps (13 critical)
- Detailed implementation specifications
- Test patterns and validation criteria
- Project standards and values

TRANSPARENCY:
- All analysis committed with evidence
