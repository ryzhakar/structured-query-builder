Subject: Add bimodal intelligence gap analysis and Phase 1 implementation plan

Message:
PROOF-OF-WORK: Comprehensive analysis of 15 existing bimodal queries
against full intelligence model specification (Pricing Analyst +
Commercial Architect personas).

KEY FINDINGS:
- Exhaustiveness: 37% coverage (7/19 intelligence concerns)
- Structural meaning: 65/100 (lacks operational metadata)
- Pricing Analyst: 64% coverage (7/11 concerns)
- Commercial Architect: 0% coverage (0/8 concerns)

GAPS IDENTIFIED:
- 13 critical query gaps across both personas
- 8 structural gaps (no metadata framework)
- 4 schema limitations (cost data, temporal patterns, BinaryArithmetic, stats functions)

HONEST ASSESSMENT:
Current implementation is excellent proof-of-technical-capability
but requires strategic depth expansion to be truly exhaustive.

DELIVERABLES:
1. BIMODAL_INTELLIGENCE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md (955 lines)
   - Complete mapping of existing queries to intelligence models
   - Gap-by-gap analysis with business impact assessment
   - Schema capability evaluation
   - Honest assessment of what's missing

2. PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (700+ lines)
   - Actionable plan to reach 70% coverage
   - 5 tasks with proof-of-work criteria
   - 10 new queries specified in detail
   - Schema fixes identified and planned
   - Clear success validation criteria

IMPACT:
This analysis provides roadmap to transform proof-of-concept
into production-grade intelligence query library.
