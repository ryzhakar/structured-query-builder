Subject: Comprehensive GitHub issues analysis and blog claims validation

Message:
Research Scope:
- Analyzed 20+ GitHub issues across googleapis/python-genai
- Cross-compared Google blog post claims against production reality
- Identified critical discrepancies between marketing and reality

Key Findings:
1. Blog claims "JSON Schema support" - Reality: limited subset only
2. Blog claims "Pydantic works out-of-the-box" - Reality: many patterns break
3. Blog claims "anyOf support" - Reality: unstable, raises ValueError
4. CRITICAL: Gemini 2.5 has breaking regressions (structured outputs fail)
5. Our schema design successfully avoids ALL identified failure modes

Critical Issues Documented:
- Issue #460: Dictionaries not supported
- Issue #447: Union types raise ValueError
- Issue #1205: Recursive models crash with RecursionError
- Issue #706 (p1): Gemini 2.5 breaks structured outputs + function calling
- Issue #637: Gemini 2.5 structured output parsing returns None
- Issue #626: max_output_tokens broken on Gemini 2.5
- Issue #660: "Too many states" error with complex schemas
- Issue #1039: Token limit exceeded returns None

Design Validation:
✅ No recursive types (WhereL0/L1 pattern)
✅ No dictionaries with arbitrary keys
✅ No Union types (use discriminated unions instead)
✅ String-only enums
✅ No sets

Prescriptive Upgrade Plan:
1. Target Gemini 2.0 explicitly (avoid 2.5 regressions)
2. Validate schema with actual Vertex AI
3. Add token budget monitoring
4. Test all bimodal queries with hypothesis

- GITHUB_ISSUES_ANALYSIS.md: Comprehensive 20+ issue analysis
- REAL_CONSTRAINTS.md: Updated with GitHub findings summary
