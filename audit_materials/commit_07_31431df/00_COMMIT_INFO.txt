Subject: Add Gemini 3 research and update recommendations

Message:
CRITICAL FIX: Previous recommendation was WRONG

Previous (Incorrect):
- Recommended Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Avoided Gemini 2.5 due to regressions
- Missed that Gemini 3 was released (November 2025)

Updated (Correct):
- Recommend Gemini 3 Pro (gemini-3-pro-preview-11-2025)
- Takes advantage of new capabilities
- Based on actual 2025 Gemini lineup research

Gemini 3 Key Improvements:
1. ✅ Grounding + Structured Outputs NOW WORKS (Issue #665 FIXED!)
   - Can combine Google Search with structured JSON output
   - Critical for pricing analysts scraping competitor sites

2. ✅ Enhanced JSON Schema Support
   - anyOf, $ref keywords officially supported
   - Better than Gemini 2.x limitations

3. 🆕 thinking_level Parameter
   - "low" for simple queries (faster, cheaper)
   - Default for complex reasoning
   - Cost optimization opportunity

4. ✅ Avoids Gemini 2.5 Regressions
   - Issues #706, #637, #626 likely fixed
   - More stable than 2.5

Pricing:
- $2/M input tokens
- $12/M output tokens
- Premium pricing for premium capabilities
